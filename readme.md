Advanced Space Combat uses a modular architecture with the following core namespaces:

```lua
ASC = {
    VERSION = "5.1.0",
    BUILD = "2025.01.15.STARGATE.ULTIMATE",
    NAME = "Advanced Space Combat - ARIA-4 Ultimate Edition with Enhanced Stargate Hyperspace",
    STATUS = "Production Ready - Ultimate Stargate Edition",
    AI = {},           -- ARIA-4 AI Assistant v5.1.0
    Weapons = {},      -- Combat systems
    UI = {},           -- User interface
    Diagnostics = {},  -- System monitoring
    Commands = {},     -- Console commands
    Debug = {}         -- Debug utilities
}

HYPERDRIVE = {
    Core = {},         -- Hyperdrive engine
    ShipCore = {},     -- Ship management
    WeaponGroups = {}, -- Weapon coordination
    UI = {}            -- Legacy UI support
}
```

## 🛸 Ship Management

### Ship Core System

The ship core is the central command system for all vessels, providing:

#### Core Functions
- **Ship Detection** - Automatically detects connected ship structure
- **Resource Management** - Handles energy and resource distribution
- **Component Coordination** - Links all ship systems together
- **Life Support** - Provides atmosphere and environmental control

#### Technical Implementation

```lua
-- Ship Core Entity Structure
ENT.Type = "asc_ship_core"
ENT.Base = "base_gmodentity"

-- Core Properties
self.ShipID = unique_identifier
self.DetectedEntities = {}
self.ResourceStorage = {
    energy = 10000,
    oxygen = 1000,
    water = 500
}

-- Real-time Updates (0.05s interval)
function ENT:Think()
    self:UpdateShipDetection()
    self:UpdateResourceDistribution()
    self:UpdateLifeSupport()
    self:NextThink(CurTime() + 0.05)
end
```

#### Visual Indicators

**Enhanced Front Indicator System (Phase 2)**
- **Green Arrow Display** - Shows ship orientation
- **Configurable Distance** - 50-300 units from core
- **Auto-Show Option** - Automatically displays on spawn
- **Smart Positioning** - Cone-shaped arrow for better visibility

```lua
-- Front Indicator Configuration
CreateFrontIndicator = function(shipCore)
    local indicator = ents.Create("prop_physics")
    indicator:SetModel("models/hunter/misc/cone1x1.mdl")
    indicator:SetPos(shipCore:GetPos() + shipCore:GetForward() * 150)
    indicator:SetColor(Color(0, 255, 0, 220))
    indicator:SetParent(shipCore)
end
```

### Audio System

**Enhanced Sound Management with CAP Integration**
- **Technology-Specific Audio** - Authentic CAP sounds based on selected technology
- **Dynamic Sound Selection** - Sounds change with technology progression
- **Quieter Defaults** - 0.15 volume (was 0.2) for pleasant ambience
- **Mute Wire Input** - Wiremod integration for sound control
- **Smart Fallback System** - Graceful audio degradation when CAP unavailable

```lua
-- Sound Priority System
local fallbackSounds = {
    "ambient/atmosphere/ambience_base.wav",  -- Most pleasant
    "ambient/atmosphere/tone_quiet.wav",     -- Quiet atmospheric
    "ambient/water/water_flow_loop1.wav",    -- Gentle water flow
    "ambient/atmosphere/wind_quiet.wav",     -- Quiet wind
    "ambient/machines/machine_hum1.wav"      -- Last resort
}
```

### Resource System

**Spacebuild 3 Integration**
- **Energy Distribution** - Automatic power management
- **Resource Scaling** - Inverse scaling based on ship size
- **Real-time Updates** - Smart recalculation system
- **Auto-Distribution** - Resources flow to newly welded entities

#### Resource Scaling Logic

```lua
-- Small ships: Fast regen, low capacity
-- Large ships: Slow regen, high capacity
local shipSize = #detectedEntities
local regenRate = math.max(10 - (shipSize / 100), 1)
local capacity = math.min(1000 + (shipSize * 10), 50000)
```

## 🌌 Hyperspace System

### 4-Stage Stargate Hyperspace Travel

The hyperspace system implements authentic Stargate travel mechanics with four distinct stages:

#### Stage 1: Initiation (3-5 seconds)
- **Energy Surge** - Power builds up across ship systems
- **Coordinate Calculation** - Navigation computer calculates jump coordinates
- **System Checks** - All ship systems verified for hyperspace compatibility
- **Visual Effects** - Blue energy patterns begin forming around ship

```lua
-- Stage 1 Implementation
function HYPERDRIVE.Core.InitiateHyperspace(shipCore, destination)
    local stage1Duration = math.random(3, 5)

    -- Energy surge effects
    HYPERDRIVE.Effects.CreateEnergySurge(shipCore)

    -- Coordinate calculation
    local coordinates = HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.CalculateCoordinates(destination)

    -- System verification
    local systemsReady = HYPERDRIVE.Core.VerifyShipSystems(shipCore)

    if systemsReady then
        timer.Simple(stage1Duration, function()
            HYPERDRIVE.Core.OpenHyperspaceWindow(shipCore, coordinates)
        end)
    end
end
```

#### Stage 2: Window Opening (2-3 seconds)
- **Hyperspace Window** - Blue/purple swirling energy tunnel opens
- **Dimensional Breach** - Reality tears open to reveal hyperspace
- **Gravitational Effects** - Space-time distortion around ship
- **Sound Effects** - Deep, resonant hyperspace activation sounds

#### Stage 3: Hyperspace Travel (5-15 seconds)
- **Stretched Starlines** - Stars become elongated light streaks
- **Dimensional Visuals** - Swirling energy patterns and cosmic phenomena
- **Time Dilation** - Subjective time distortion effects
- **Navigation Hazards** - Gravitational anomalies and energy storms

#### Stage 4: Exit (2-4 seconds)
- **Light Flash** - Brilliant white light as ship exits hyperspace
- **System Stabilization** - All ship systems return to normal operation
- **Coordinate Verification** - Confirm arrival at intended destination
- **Status Updates** - Ship systems report successful jump completion

### Technical Implementation

```lua
-- Hyperspace Core System
HYPERDRIVE.Core = {
    -- Active hyperspace sessions
    ActiveJumps = {},

    -- Jump calculation
    CalculateJumpTime = function(distance, shipMass)
        local baseTime = 5
        local distanceModifier = math.min(distance / 10000, 10)
        local massModifier = math.min(shipMass / 1000, 5)
        return baseTime + distanceModifier + massModifier
    end,

    -- Energy requirements
    CalculateEnergyCost = function(distance, shipMass)
        local baseCost = 1000
        local distanceCost = distance * 0.1
        local massCost = shipMass * 0.5
        return baseCost + distanceCost + massCost
    end
}
```

### Navigation System

**Advanced Coordinate System**
- **3D Coordinate Grid** - Full 3D space navigation
- **Bookmark System** - Save frequently used destinations
- **Auto-Navigation** - AI-assisted route planning
- **Hazard Detection** - Automatic obstacle avoidance

```lua
-- Navigation Implementation
HYPERDRIVE.Navigation = {
    -- Coordinate validation
    ValidateCoordinates = function(coords)
        -- Check for obstacles
        local obstacles = ents.FindInSphere(coords, 500)

        -- Verify safe landing zone
        local safeZone = HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.CheckSafeZone(coords)

        return #obstacles == 0 and safeZone
    end,

    -- Bookmark management
    Bookmarks = {},

    SaveBookmark = function(name, coordinates)
        HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.Bookmarks[name] = coordinates
    end
}
```

### Enhanced Targeting System (Phase 3)

**Predictive Targeting Algorithm**
```lua
-- Advanced targeting with lead calculation
function ASC.Weapons.Core.PredictTargetPosition(target, distance)
    if not ASC.Weapons.Config.PredictiveTargeting then
        return target:GetPos()
    end

    local velocity = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetEntityVelocity(target)
    local projectileSpeed = 1000 -- Average projectile speed
    local timeToTarget = distance / projectileSpeed

    return target:GetPos() + velocity * timeToTarget
end
```

**Multi-Target Engagement**
- **Primary Target** - Main threat with highest priority
- **Secondary Targets** - Up to 2 additional targets tracked simultaneously
- **Threat Assessment** - Dynamic priority calculation based on distance, weapons, and behavior

**Smart Target Scoring**
```lua
function ASC.Weapons.Core.CalculateTargetScore(target, distance, weaponSystem)
    local score = 1000 - distance -- Base score inversely related to distance

    -- Threat assessment bonuses
    if target:IsPlayer() then score = score + 500 end
    if target:GetClass() == "asc_ship_core" then score = score + 300 end
    if target.GetWeaponCount and target:GetWeaponCount() > 0 then score = score + 200 end

    return math.max(score, 0)
end
```

### Weapon Groups

**Coordinated Fire Control**
- **Simultaneous Fire** - All weapons fire at once
- **Sequential Fire** - Weapons fire one after another
- **Alternating Fire** - Weapons fire in alternating pattern
- **Salvo Fire** - Timed sequential firing with delays

```lua
-- Weapon Group Implementation
WeaponGroup = {
    weapons = {},
    fireMode = "SIMULTANEOUS", -- SEQUENTIAL, ALTERNATING, SALVO
    target = nil,

    Fire = function(self)
        if self.fireMode == "SIMULTANEOUS" then
            for _, weapon in ipairs(self.weapons) do
                weapon:FireWeapon(self.target)
            end
        elseif self.fireMode == "SEQUENTIAL" then
            -- Sequential firing logic
        end
    end
}
```

### Tactical AI System

**AI Behavior Modes**
- **DEFENSIVE** - Prioritize ship protection, conservative engagement
- **AGGRESSIVE** - Active threat hunting, maximum firepower
- **SUPPORT** - Coordinate with allied ships, provide covering fire

**Threat Assessment Matrix**
```lua
-- AI threat evaluation
function ASC.TacticalAI.EvaluateThreat(entity, aiData)
    local threat = {
        entity = entity,
        distance = aiData.shipPos:Distance(entity:GetPos()),
        weaponCount = entity.GetWeaponCount and entity:GetWeaponCount() or 0,
        shieldStrength = entity.GetShieldStrength and entity:GetShieldStrength() or 0,
        velocity = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetEntityVelocity(entity)
    }

    -- Calculate threat level (1-10)
    threat.level = math.min(
        (threat.weaponCount * 2) +
        (1000 / math.max(threat.distance, 100)) +
        (threat.velocity:Length() / 100),
        10
    )

    return threat

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Ship Core Not Detecting Ship
**Symptoms**: Ship core doesn't recognize attached components
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure components are within 2000 units of ship core
2. Check that entities are properly welded/constrained
3. Verify ship core is not damaged or disabled
4. Use `aria diagnostic` for automated detection

```lua
-- Manual ship detection refresh
local shipCore = ASC.AI.FindPlayerShipCore(LocalPlayer())
if IsValid(shipCore) then
    shipCore:UpdateShipDetection()
end
```

#### Weapons Not Firing
**Symptoms**: Weapons don't respond to fire commands
**Solutions**:
1. Check energy levels in ship core
2. Verify weapon is registered with ship core
3. Ensure target is within weapon range
4. Check weapon group configuration

```lua
-- Debug weapon status
local status = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetWeaponStatus(shipID)
print("Weapons: " .. status.weapons)
print("Energy: " .. status.ammo.energy)
```

#### Hyperspace Jump Failures
**Symptoms**: Hyperspace jumps fail to initiate or complete
**Solutions**:
1. Verify sufficient energy for jump
2. Check destination coordinates are valid
3. Ensure ship core is functional
4. Validate ship mass is within limits

```lua
-- Check jump requirements
local distance = startPos:Distance(endPos)
local mass = HYPERDRIVE.Core.CalculateShipMass(shipCore)
local energy, time = HYPERDRIVE.Core.CalculateJumpRequirements(distance, mass)
print("Required energy: " .. energy .. ", Available: " .. shipCore:GetEnergy())
```

#### AI Assistant Not Responding
**Symptoms**: ARIA-4 doesn't respond to commands
**Solutions**:
1. Check if AI system is enabled (`asc_enable_ai_system 1`)
2. Verify web access is working (`asc_ai_web_access 1`)
3. Ensure content filter is not blocking responses
4. Try basic commands first (`aria help`)

### Performance Issues

#### Low FPS with Large Ships
**Solutions**:
1. Enable performance mode (`asc_performance_mode 1`)
2. Reduce update rates for non-critical systems
3. Disable UI animations (`asc_ui_animations 0`)
4. Limit number of active weapon systems

#### Network Lag in Multiplayer
**Solutions**:
1. Increase server network rates
2. Reduce ship detection frequency
3. Optimize weapon firing rates
4. Use weapon groups instead of individual weapons

### Debug Commands

#### System Diagnostics
```
asc_diagnostics              - Full system health check
