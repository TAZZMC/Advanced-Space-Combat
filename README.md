## üåå Hyperspace System

### 4-Stage Stargate Hyperspace Travel

The hyperspace system implements authentic Stargate travel mechanics with four distinct stages:

#### Stage 1: Initiation (3-5 seconds)
- **Energy Surge** - Power builds up across ship systems
- **Coordinate Calculation** - Navigation computer calculates jump coordinates
- **System Checks** - All ship systems verified for hyperspace compatibility
- **Visual Effects** - Blue energy patterns begin forming around ship

```lua
-- Stage 1 Implementation
function HYPERDRIVE.Core.InitiateHyperspace(shipCore, destination)
    local stage1Duration = math.random(3, 5)

    -- Energy surge effects
    HYPERDRIVE.Effects.CreateEnergySurge(shipCore)

    -- Coordinate calculation
    local coordinates = HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.CalculateCoordinates(destination)

    -- System verification
    local systemsReady = HYPERDRIVE.Core.VerifyShipSystems(shipCore)

    if systemsReady then
        timer.Simple(stage1Duration, function()
            HYPERDRIVE.Core.OpenHyperspaceWindow(shipCore, coordinates)
        end)
    end
end
```

#### Stage 2: Window Opening (2-3 seconds)
- **Hyperspace Window** - Blue/purple swirling energy tunnel opens
- **Dimensional Breach** - Reality tears open to reveal hyperspace
- **Gravitational Effects** - Space-time distortion around ship
- **Sound Effects** - Deep, resonant hyperspace activation sounds

- **System Stabilization** - All ship systems return to normal operation
- **Coordinate Verification** - Confirm arrival at intended destination
- **Status Updates** - Ship systems report successful jump completion

### Technical Implementation

```lua
-- Hyperspace Core System
HYPERDRIVE.Core = {
    -- Active hyperspace sessions
    ActiveJumps = {},

    -- Jump calculation
    CalculateJumpTime = function(distance, shipMass)
        local baseTime = 5
        local distanceModifier = math.min(distance / 10000, 10)
        local massModifier = math.min(shipMass / 1000, 5)
        return baseTime + distanceModifier + massModifier
    end,

    -- Energy requirements
    CalculateEnergyCost = function(distance, shipMass)
        local baseCost = 1000
        local distanceCost = distance * 0.1
        local massCost = shipMass * 0.5
        return baseCost + distanceCost + massCost
    end
}
```

### Navigation System

**Advanced Coordinate System**
- **3D Coordinate Grid** - Full 3D space navigation

    -- Coordinate validation
    ValidateCoordinates = function(coords)
        -- Check for obstacles
        local obstacles = ents.FindInSphere(coords, 500)

        -- Verify safe landing zone
        local safeZone = HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.CheckSafeZone(coords)

        return #obstacles == 0 and safeZone
    end,

    -- Bookmark management
    Bookmarks = {},

    SaveBookmark = function(name, coordinates)
        HYPERDRIVE.Navigation.Bookmarks[name] = coordinates
    end
}

function ASC.Weapons.Core.PredictTargetPosition(target, distance)
    if not ASC.Weapons.Config.PredictiveTargeting then
        return target:GetPos()
    end

    local velocity = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetEntityVelocity(target)

    -- Threat assessment bonuses
    if target:IsPlayer() then score = score + 500 end
    if target:GetClass() == "asc_ship_core" then score = score + 300 end
    if target.GetWeaponCount and target:GetWeaponCount() > 0 then score = score + 200 end

    return math.max(score, 0)
end
```

### Weapon Groups

**Coordinated Fire Control**
- **Simultaneous Fire** - All weapons fire at once
- **Sequential Fire** - Weapons fire one after another
- **Alternating Fire** - Weapons fire in alternating pattern
- **Salvo Fire** - Timed sequential firing with delays

```lua
-- Weapon Group Implementation
WeaponGroup = {
    weapons = {},
    fireMode = "SIMULTANEOUS", -- SEQUENTIAL, ALTERNATING, SALVO
    target = nil,

    Fire = function(self)
        if self.fireMode == "SIMULTANEOUS" then
            for _, weapon in ipairs(self.weapons) do
                weapon:FireWeapon(self.target)
            end
        elseif self.fireMode == "SEQUENTIAL" then
            -- Sequential firing logic
        end
    end
}
```

### Tactical AI System

**AI Behavior Modes**
- **DEFENSIVE** - Prioritize ship protection, conservative engagement
- **AGGRESSIVE** - Active threat hunting, maximum firepower
- **SUPPORT** - Coordinate with allied ships, provide covering fire

**Threat Assessment Matrix**
```lua
-- AI threat evaluation
function ASC.TacticalAI.EvaluateThreat(entity, aiData)
    local threat = {
        entity = entity,
        distance = aiData.shipPos:Distance(entity:GetPos()),
        weaponCount = entity.GetWeaponCount and entity:GetWeaponCount() or 0,
        shieldStrength = entity.GetShieldStrength and entity:GetShieldStrength() or 0,
        velocity = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetEntityVelocity(entity)
    }

    -- Calculate threat level (1-10)
    threat.level = math.min(
        (threat.weaponCount * 2) +
        (1000 / math.max(threat.distance, 100)) +
        (threat.velocity:Length() / 100),

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Ship Core Not Detecting Ship
**Symptoms**: Ship core doesn't recognize attached components
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure components are within 2000 units of ship core
2. Check that entities are properly welded/constrained
3. Verify ship core is not damaged or disabled
4. Use `aria diagnostic` for automated detection

```lua
-- Manual ship detection refresh
local shipCore = ASC.AI.FindPlayerShipCore(LocalPlayer())
if IsValid(shipCore) then
    shipCore:UpdateShipDetection()
end
```

#### Weapons Not Firing
**Symptoms**: Weapons don't respond to fire commands
**Solutions**:
1. Check energy levels in ship core
2. Verify weapon is registered with ship core
3. Ensure target is within weapon range
4. Check weapon group configuration

```lua
-- Debug weapon status
local status = ASC.Weapons.Core.GetWeaponStatus(shipID)
print("Weapons: " .. status.weapons)
print("Energy: " .. status.ammo.energy)
```

#### Hyperspace Jump Failures
**Symptoms**: Hyperspace jumps fail to initiate or complete
**Solutions**:
1. Verify sufficient energy for jump
2. Check destination coordinates are valid
3. Ensure ship core is functional
4. Validate ship mass is within limits

```lua
-- Check jump requirements
local distance = startPos:Distance(endPos)
local mass = HYPERDRIVE.Core.CalculateShipMass(shipCore)
local energy, time = HYPERDRIVE.Core.CalculateJumpRequirements(distance, mass)
print("Required energy: " .. energy .. ", Available: " .. shipCore:GetEnergy())
```

#### AI Assistant Not Responding
**Symptoms**: ARIA-4 doesn't respond to commands
**Solutions**:
1. Check if AI system is enabled (`asc_enable_ai_system 1`)
2. Verify web access is working (`asc_ai_web_access 1`)
3. Ensure content filter is not blocking responses
4. Try basic commands first (`aria help`)

### Performance Issues

#### Low FPS with Large Ships
**Solutions**:
1. Enable performance mode (`asc_performance_mode 1`)
2. Reduce update rates for non-critical systems
3. Disable UI animations (`asc_ui_animations 0`)
4. Limit number of active weapon systems

#### Network Lag in Multiplayer
**Solutions**:
1. Increase server network rates
2. Reduce ship detection frequency
3. Optimize weapon firing rates
4. Use weapon groups instead of individual weapons

### Debug Commands

#### System Diagnostics
```
asc_diagnostics              - Full system health check
asc_debug_mode 1             - Enable debug output
asc_status                   - System status overview
